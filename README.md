# Fairness-Aware-Classification

This repository contains three methods to address fairness issues in classification problems implemented by the team of Bekarys Nurtay, Simona Nitti, Ksenia Osipova, Kirill Myasoedov and Gabriel Rozzonelli during a Machine Learning Project at Skoltech, 2021.

## Problem discription
- *Problem:* AI-decision making systems are noticed in discrimination: 
    - advertising of highly paid jobs more men than women ([Googleâ€™s AdFicher](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/danupam/dtd-pets15.pdf))
    - ignoring of city areas inhabited mostly by black people for eligibility to advanced services of [Amazon](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-amazon-same-day/)

- *Protected (sensitive) group* - group of people which can be subjected to discrimination on the basis of gender, race, age, etc. (ex: females, blacks)

- *Sensitive feature* - feature characterizing discrimination basis (ex: gender, race)

- *Clasiifiers* implemented in order to deal with fairness problrm:

- *Equalized Odds* - fairness metrics, measures the difference of true classified samples between sensitive and non-sensitive groups

- Other **Metrics** to assess fairness:
    - Accuracy
    - Balanced accuracy
    - True Positive Rate for protected group
    - True Positive Rate for non-protected group
    - True Negative Rate for protected group
    - True Negative Rate for non-protected group

- *Datasets* for running experiments:
    - [Adult Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult)
    - [Bank marketing Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)
    - [Compass Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census-Income+(KDD))
    - [Census-Income (KDD) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census-Income+(KDD))

## Results

Four algorithms (including original AdaBoost) were run and tested via bootstrap with 10 test-train splits of ration 0.5. The results of these runs on four datasets are represented below.
